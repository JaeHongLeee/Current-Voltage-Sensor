# Current-Voltage-Sensor

It is a program code that calculates the power of the alternating current by receiving the current and voltage values of the noncontact current sensor with controllers such as ESP32 and Arduino.

## using 10A, 1V noncontact current sensor

insert 0A (Using Analog Discovery 2)
